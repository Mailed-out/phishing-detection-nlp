#Phishing Detection using NLP
## Overview
This project explores phishing email detection using Natural Language Processing(NLP).
We compare traditional  machine learning approaches with transformer-based language models to understand performance trade-off and failure cases.
## Motivation
Phishing attacks are a major security threat,often relying on linguistic manipulation.
Automated detection using language models can help identify such attacks at scale.
## Planned Approach 
* Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis 
*Baseline model:TF-IDF +Logistic Regression
*Advanced Model:Transformer-based classifier(BERT/DistilBERT)
*Model comparison and error analysis
## Tools & Technologies
Python
Scikit-learn
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
## Status
Project Initialization and dataset exploration
